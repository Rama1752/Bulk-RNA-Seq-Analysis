# Bulk RNA-Seq Results Summary

## 1. Global Transcriptomic Structure
- Principal component analysis revealed clear separation of treatment conditions, with PC1 explaining 87.0% of the variance and PC2 explaining 6.0%.
- Biological replicates clustered tightly within conditions, indicating high reproducibility.

## 2. Differential Gene Expression

### IL-1β vs Control
- 4489 genes were differentially expressed (padj < 0.05, |log2FC| ≥ 1).
- 2456 genes were upregulated and 2033 genes were downregulated.

### Cyproheptadine + IL-1β vs IL-1β
- 1098 genes were differentially expressed.
- 435 genes were upregulated and 663 genes were downregulated.

## 3. Cyproheptadine Reverses the IL-1β Inflammatory Response
- 295 IL-1β–induced genes were significantly suppressed by cyproheptadine.
- This corresponds to 6.57% of IL-1β–responsive genes, indicating partial but targeted transcriptomic rescue.

## 4. Inflammatory Pathway Analysis (GSEA)

### HALLMARK_INFLAMMATORY_RESPONSE
- IL-1β vs Control: pathway strongly activated (NES = 2.78, FDR = 0.000501).
- Cyproheptadine + IL-1β vs IL-1β: pathway significantly suppressed (NES = -2.19, FDR = 0.00037).

## 5. Key Conclusions
- IL-1β induces a robust inflammatory transcriptional program in human chondrocytes.
- Cyproheptadine significantly attenuates IL-1β–driven inflammatory signaling without globally suppressing transcription.
- These results support a protective, anti-inflammatory role for cyproheptadine under osteoarthritic conditions.
